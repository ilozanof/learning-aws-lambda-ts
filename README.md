# learning-aws-lambda

This project contains the Code I've developed while following the Course "AWS & Typescript Masterclass - CDK, Serverless, React" from the UDEMY Platform.

It needs the folowing to be used:
 * An AWS Account so we can generate a Secret Access Key
 * An AWS client installedand configured with the previous Access Key
 * A GitHub Account so we can create a Token
